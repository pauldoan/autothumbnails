- **Automatic Transcription**: Converts the audio into text using a Speech-to-Text model.
- **Content Summarization**: Summarizes the transcript to capture the main theme for thumbnail creation.
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Uses AI to generate multiple YouTube-style thumbnail images.
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Replicate API token](https://replicate.com/account) (Youâ€™ll need to sign up and get an API key)
- ffmpeg (for handling media files; install instructions below)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autothumbnails.git
cd autothumbnails
```

### Install Dependencies
Use `pip` to install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install ffmpeg
- **Ubuntu**: 
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ffmpeg
  ```
- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```
- **Windows**: 
  Download the executable from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and follow the setup instructions.

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your Replicate API token:
```bash
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token_here
```

## Usage

### Running the App
To start the Streamlit app, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open in your default web browser. Alternatively, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

### Using the App
1. **Upload a File**: Click on the "Upload an audio or video file" section to upload your audio or video file. Supported formats include MP3, M4A, WAV, MP4, MOV, and AVI.
2. **Select Number of Thumbnails**: Use the number input to specify how many thumbnails you want to generate (1-4).
3. **File Type Display**: After uploading, the app displays the file type (audio or video) and provides an audio player for audio files or a video player for video files.
4. **Processing**: The app automatically processes the file, transcribes the audio, generates a summary, and creates the thumbnails.
5. **Thumbnails Display**: View the generated thumbnails on the app interface, which you can download by right-clicking on the images.

## Customization

### Adjusting the Number of Thumbnails
The default maximum number of thumbnails is set to 4. To change this, modify the `st.number_input` line in `app.py`:
```python
num_thumbnails = st.number_input("Number of thumbnails to generate", min_value=1, max_value=4, value=4, step=1)
```
You can increase `max_value` to allow more thumbnails.

### Changing Models
The app currently uses the following models:
- **Speech-to-Text**: `"vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper"`
- **Summarization**: `"meta/meta-llama-3-8b-instruct"`
- **Thumbnail Generation**: `"black-forest-labs/flux-schnell"`

If you want to try other models, replace these model IDs in the `replicate.run` calls.

### Customizing the Prompt
The prompt for generating the thumbnail description can be customized to fit different use cases. Update this line in `app.py` for different prompt styles:
```python
prompt = f"Create an engaging and concise YouTube video description for the following transcript: {transcript_text}. Only output the description."
```
